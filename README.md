# CDR-analysis-K-means-clustering-with-privacy-protection-and-integrity-verification

Data Description A daily activity file from Dandelion API is used as a data source, where the file contains CDR records generated by the Telecom Italia cellular network over the city of Milano. The daily CDR activity file contains information for 10, 000 grids about SMS in and out, Call in and out, and Internet activity. This dataset has 5 Million records. We preprocess the dataset into a regularized dataset containing only two dimensions: "activity_time", "total_activity",
```
CDR_raw_2d_Z.zip
```

Unzip the data set and put the following files in the same directory to run:
```
mvhe.py
kmeans.py
kmeansvhe.py
CDR_raw_2d_Z.txt
```

Also, we designe a smart contract for integrity verification
```
TMC_contract.sol
```
